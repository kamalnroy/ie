Dear Professor,

Apologies for submitting my assignment a bit late. As I had requested you for a few days of postponement because immediately after the exam I had to travel and I got sick once I landed up at home. 

However, the Tableau dashboard design and the accompanying document is contained in the attached zip file. The zip archive contains the following items:
1. "Instructions.txt" - this docuement details the steps required to open the Tableau dashboard document.
2. "Procurement of food items for Rohingyas refugees in Bangladesh and Myanmar.png" - a PNG file which is a pictorial snapshot of the dashboard
3. "GlobalFoodPricesDbDump" - a folder containing the DB dump of the "star model" that we had created during the ETL design(group work). This DB dump needs to be imported first into the MySql so that the dashbaord may connect with the DB (Instrctions for doing so are detailed in "Instrctions.txt" in step 1)
4. "Dashboard Definition Document.docx" - This is one of the deliverables. This document contains the details about the dashbaord such as audience, objective, insights that can be gleaned from dashboard, and also the areas of improvement in the dashboard
5. "MarketPricesOfFoodItemsInSouthEastAsia.twb" - The dashbaord design.

I have tested all the steps detailed above so that you may not have any difficulty in opening the dashboard. However, in case you face any difficulty or you need any clarifications, kindly let me know.

Warm Regards,
Kamal
