Steps to run the test:
1. Ideally the model should be synchronized with the DB, but there is some issue of referntial integrity, we are not able to do so. 
But to run the testing of the job, we need to have the database structure in place, so as a stop-gap arrangement, we need to go to the workbench, connect to the database and run the following SQL commands; running this commands would put into place all the tables in the DB.

create database testglobalfoodprices
use testglobalfoodprices
CREATE TABLE d_market (id INT, _name VARCHAR(64), province VARCHAR(64), country VARCHAR(64), description VARCHAR(128));

CREATE TABLE d_currency (id INT, _name VARCHAR(64), country VARCHAR(64), description VARCHAR(128));

CREATE TABLE d_date (id INT, month INT, year INT, description VARCHAR(128));

CREATE TABLE d_pricetype (id INT, _name VARCHAR(64), description VARCHAR(128));

CREATE TABLE d_unit (id INT, _name VARCHAR(64), description VARCHAR(128));

CREATE TABLE d_commodity (id INT, _name VARCHAR(64), description VARCHAR(128));

CREATE TABLE f_commoditymarketprices (id INT, d_date_id INT, d_commodity_id INT, d_currency_id INT, d_market_id INT, d_pricetype_id INT, d_unittype_id INT, market_price INT, market_price_source VARCHAR(128), description VARCHAR(128));


2. After this switch to pentaho and open all the transformations and jobs(esp. "Job_GlobalFoodPrices" )

3. In Pentaho go to the DB connections section(View->DatabaseConnections) where you will find a Shared database connection called "GlobalFoodPricesDataConn". Clik on that and provide the right credentials for the MySql DB such as db-host, db-port, username, password etc. Make sure that the DB schema name is "testglobalfoodprices".
For a sanity check, just check if the databse connection is working by clicking "Test" button.

4. Make sure that the "GlobalFoodPricesDatabase.csv" is in the same folder where the job "Job_GlobalFoodPrices" is present.

5. Goto "Job_GlobalFoodPrices" and click "Run"

6. The job would start running and all the relevant tables will be populated with the data from CSV.
